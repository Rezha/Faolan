- done in Graphics2D (pure)

- make opening menu. 
  - appropriate theme music
  - buttons and everything
  - rectangles, basic textures.
- make game engine.
  - straight 2D. Forget about isometric for now.
  - stuff like sprite compatability, moving, which tiles can be moved on, etc.
- write script outline draft
  - spend time on this
- ... find / make textures...
  - remember, it's okay if it's pixely, cuz who cares and you can get better textures later
