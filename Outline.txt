- done in Graphics2D (pure)

- make opening menu. 
  - appropriate theme music
  - buttons and everything
  - rectangles, basic textures.
- make game engine.
  - straight 2D. Forget about isometric for now. (possible later addition)
  - stuff like sprite compatability, moving, which tiles can be moved on, etc.
- write script outline draft
  - spend time on this
- ... find / make textures...
  - remember, it's okay if it's pixely, cuz who cares and you can get better textures later

- somehow find sounds. Perhaps just take from a ftp game already made for now?

- plan to keep this in java. If it gets big in java already, transitioning to C++ or python later is 
probably not going to be feasible. 
Probably.
Not without help.



Plot:

You wake up in an abandoned farmhouse. You have no idea about your past.
Through interactions with some people you find traveling in the forest (kids? idk) you deduce you are a 
major criminal (originally the idea was serial killer but i guess that's too graphic) but now with
amnesia so you have no idea about anything right now. 

You play the game, living the life that you are now shown how to live, slowly building relationships with 
townspeople etc. (emphasis on the interactions you need to do, how your actions affect things deeply).

You can also slowly remember your memories in specific situations; slowly however, you soon realize that 
there are periods of time which you just don't remember, and bad things seem to happen in these times. 
You might lose control of your character at times, saying things that you didn't want to say, for example, 
but you will also gain skills. 
There is a way to regain control, but it probably revolves around boringish tasks (that will have shortcuts.?idk)

You CAN'T marry, but can have friendships? idk (i plan for the story to have a relatively long time frame)

You CAN travel out of town to a FEW locations.

I WILL attempt to make an accurate economy simulator, with each NPC perhaps representing 10 people or 50, for a 
more accurate population size?, and then use their actions to predict the economy. 
Yes, NPCs must also have needs.



Graphics: As of now, simple 2d. I might consider isometric or even 3d in the future (prob not) if I eventually 
gather the skills.
